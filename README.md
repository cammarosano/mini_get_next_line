# (mini) get_next_line

This is a minimalist version of 42's project get_next_line, reading from standard input. The complete (validated) get_next_line project can be found [here](https://github.com/cammarosano/get_next_line).

A simple main if provided for testing: `./gcc main.c get_next_line.c -o tester`    
Example:  
```
./tester
write  
something  
[ctrl - D]
```
or (having an input_file with some text):
```
./tester < input_file
```
Not Norm compliant!
